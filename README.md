# ZEBRA
**Zero-carbon Energy Building Research Activity**

The ZEBRA project is exploring the use of smart building technologies to improve comfort levels, reduce energy demand and enable flexibility within a real-world built environment.

The ZEBRA project is run by researchers in the Energy and Power Group at the Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford, UK, based at Holywell House, Osney Mead.

This respository contains a variety of material used in the setup and operation of the ZEBRA infrastructure at Holywell House that needs to be publically accessible. Documentation on hardware, scripts for data access and analysis, and control can be found in the [ZEBRA private respository](https://github.com/EPGOxford/ZEBRA).
